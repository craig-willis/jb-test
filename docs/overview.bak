### Overview

The TRACE project is addressing a key challenge to ensuring the transparency of
published computational research: 


**How can we trust the integrity of results from research that relies on
computations without repeating them?**


The TRACE project is addressing challenges in trusting and verifying the results
of computational research. The integrity of results is uncertain when their
lineage or production cannot be validated, but verification through repeating
executions is expensive and inefficient -- when possible. TRACE is developing a
model of certified transparency whereby the original execution of a
computational workflow is certified by the system on which they were run.
